Teachable Machine Image Classification Demo

Welcome to the CODED-CC-Task repository! This project is designed to help you learn how to use Teachable Machine for creating an image classification model. By the end of this demo, you'll have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts and how to apply them using Teachable Machine.

Objectives

Understand what Teachable Machine is and its capabilities.
Learn how to gather and prepare data for a machine learning model.
Create and train an image classification model to distinguish between different categories (e.g., cats and dogs).
Test the accuracy of your model and learn how to improve it.
How to Use This Repository

Start by reading the Getting Started Guide in the docs folder.
Use the images in the example_images directory to train your first model. Feel free to add more images for better accuracy.
Follow the instructions to train, test, and refine your model.
