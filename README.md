Teachable Machine Image Classification Demo

Welcome to the CODED-CC-Task repository! This project is designed to help you learn how to use Teachable Machine for creating an image classification model. By the end of this demo, you'll have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts and how to apply them using Teachable Machine.

Objectives

-Understand what Teachable Machine is and its capabilities.
-Learn how to gather and prepare data for a machine learning model.
-Create and train an image classification model to distinguish between different categories (e.g., cats and dogs).
-Test the accuracy of your model and learn how to improve it.

How to Use This Repository

-Start by reading the Getting Started Guide in the docs folder.
-Use the images in the example_images directory to train your first model. Feel free to add more images for better accuracy.
-Follow the instructions to train, test, and refine your model.
